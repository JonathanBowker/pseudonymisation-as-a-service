# What is pseudonymisation?
Pseudonymisation uses forms of encryption to translate identifiable personal data points to unique artificial identifiers - _Pseudonyms_. Pseudonymisation techniques aim to disassociate individuals from personal data sets held by data custodians - _**e.g. unit within an organisation, personal information managemet system, interconnected network of stakeholders, or third party provider**_. This renders the data ‘pseudonymous’ for specific use cases. 

Beyond the context of a specified use case, the individuals associated with personal data can be identified, but protected by internal procedures and controls defiend and governed by the controlling data custodian. Within a structured pseudonymised data model, plain text personal data points still exist but only within physically and logically separated storage joined by securely controlled linking functions and pseudonym maps to facilate identification.

# What is personal data profiling?
In Article 4 (4), the UK GDPR defines Profiling as follows:
> _“ **'profiling’** means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements."_

Profiling can be used for predicting the data subject’s behaviour and can be a valuable tool for social media monitoring, and direct or indirect marketing and analysis. UK and EU GDPR also provides data subjects with rights related to automated decision making, including profiling, when the processing has legal or similarly significant consequences for them. For example, it is prohibited to deny a request for service or product based only on automated processing of the information about an individual without human oversight or intervention, becuase this could result in significant and potentially legal consequences for those individuals. 

# How to use pseudonymisation to your advantage?
Pseudonymised data is suitable for a wide range of analytical activities, research projects and for statistical purposes. Pseudonomysation exposes less personal data and decreases risk of abuse to exposed data, especially in the case of a personal data breach. In addition, UK and EU GDPR allows more relaxed standards for processing data that is pseudonymised compared to the processing of plain text personal data, which is motivating conytollers and processors to adopt pseudonymisation as a method for securing the personal data under their custodianship. When data is "strongly pseudonymised" it is less likely to “significantly affect” data subjects in the event of data leakage, or produce “legal effects” for them because they are less exposed to risk of re-identification.

If you or your organisation engages in profiling activities, pseudonomysing personal data prior to processing will subject them to more relaxed standards. The application of advanced pseudonymisation techniques can provide acceptable “security measures” to safeguard data subjects’ rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. Using these techniques can yield positive results by creating identifiable groups and sub-groups of individuals that can be targeted with relevant product and service offerings.

When appropriately implemented and managed, pseudonymisation can open up more opportunities for processing personal data than processing plain text data without pseudonymisation as a security measure. However, it is still critcal to treat pseudonymised data as personal data, and to safeguard data subjects’ rights, freedoms and legitimate interests.

# How can we help?
Pseudonymisation techniques have well understood and intrinsic properties but this does not render the choice and implementation of a right technique for a specific use case a trivial task in practice. By taking a risk-based approach, we help our clients assess the data protection levels required by regulators in correlation with their requirements for utility and scalability. This helps them shape their technology according to regulatory requirements and supports:

* **Data controllers and processors** with the implementation of advanced pseudonymisation systems following, taking into account the purpose and overall context of their processing activities, in line with the utility and scalability levels they wish to achieve.

* **Producers of products, services and applications** with providing adequate information to controllers and processors regarding their use of pseudonymisation techniques to safegaurd personal data and the levels of data protection they provide.

# Advanced pseudonymisation service
We work closely with global privacy teams to provide practical guidance for risk assessment and advise on best practice in the field of data pseudonymisation. We provide access to the advanced tools, technologies and techniques needed for building state-of-the-art pseudonymisation management systems and automated compliance programmes.

## Service modules
The outline of the service is as follows:

- Implementing a dictionary of terms and relevant explanatory notes.
- Identifying scenarios where pseudonymisation needs to be engaged.
- Assessing adversarial and attack models for specific pseudonymisation use cases.
- Selecting appropriate pseudonymisation techniques and control procedures.
- Applying pseudonymisation techniques to identifiers and other sensitive data.
- Implementing a pseudonymisation management system and safegaurd automation.
- Providing ongoing support for state-of-the-art techniques for stakeholders.

Overall we focus on assessing, building and implementing technical legal solutions for personal data custodians with privacy by design. We facilitate the secure processing and management of personal data at scale.
