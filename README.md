# What is pseudonymisation?
Pseudonymisation uses a form of encryption to translate identifiable personal data points to unique artificial identifiers - pseudonyms. It technique aims to de-link a person from personal data held under custodianship. This renders the data ‘pseudonymous’ within a specific use case, but beyond this use case the person can still be re-identified through clearly defined procedures and controls. This technique can applied to personal data as an acceptable security measure under GDPR to preventing linking personal data to the identity of the person to whom it belongs.

Pseudonymised data can still be traced to the data subject but it requires external information to do so. The personal data points still exist but through technically enforced separation and explicit amd implicit linking functions.

# What is personal data profiling?
In Article 4 (4), the UK GDPR defines Profiling as follows:
> _“ **'profiling’** means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements."_

Profiling can be used for predicting the data subject’s behaviour and can be a valuable tool for social media monitoring, and direct or indirect marketing and analysis. UK and EU GDPR palos provides data subjects with related to automated decision making including profiling when the processing has legal or similarly significant consequences for them. For example, it is prohibited to deny a request for service or product purley based on the automated processing of the information about an individual, becuase this could result in significant and potentially legal consequences for that person. 

# How to use pseudonymisation to your advantage?
Pseudonymised data is suitable for a great range of analytical activities, research projects and for statistical purposes. Pseudonomysation exposes less personal data and decreases the risk of abuse of exposed data, especially in the case of a personal data breach. UK and EU GDPR allows more relaxed standards for data that is pseudonymised compared to plain text personal data, which is motivating data-driven businesses to adopt pseudonymisation as a method for securing the personal data they process or hold under their custodianship. When data is "strongly pseudonymised" it is less likely to “significantly affect” data subjects or produce “legal effects” for them because they are less exposed to the risk of reidentification.

If you or your organisation engages in profiling activities, pseudonomysing the data used will be subject to the more relaxed standards. Applying appropriate pseudonymisation techniques can provide suitable “security measures” to safeguard data subjects’ rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. Using pseudonomysation techniques for profiling and grouping personal data can yield positive achieve positive results by creating identifiable groups and sub-groups of individuals that can be target with relevant service or product offerings.

When appropriately managed, pseudonymisation can open more opportunities for processing personal data than processing plain text data without pseudonymisation as a security measure. However, it is still important to treat pseudonymised data as personal data and observe the rights of data subjects. 

# How can we help?
Pseudonymisation techniques have well understood and intrinsic properties but this does not render the choice and implementation of a proper pseudonymisation technique for a specific use case a trivial task in practice.  Taking a risk-based approach, we help to assess required data protection levels, and utility and scalability to help shape your technology according to data protection and privacy requirements. We help our clienst to grow efficiently and impress their customers with higher quality data privacy and protection and reduce risk by providing support to:

* **Data controllers and processors** that need to carefully consider the implementation of pseudonymisation following a risk-based approach, taking into account the purpose and overall context of the personal data processing, as well as the utility and scalability levels they wish to achieve.

* **Producers of products, services and applications** who should provide adequate information to controllers and processors regarding their use of pseudonymisation techniques and the security and the data protection levels that they provide.

**We provide practical guidance for data controllers and processors for assessing risk and advise on best practice in the field of pseudonymisation. As well as access to advanced tools and expertise for building state-of-the-art pseudonymisation management systems.**
