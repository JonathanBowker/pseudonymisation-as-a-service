# Pseudonymisation-as-a-service
At Advanced Analytica we work closely with global privacy teams to provide practical guidance for risk assessment and advise on best practice in the field of data pseudonymisation. We provide access to advanced tools, technologies and techniques required for building state-of-the-art pseudonymisation management systems and automated compliance programmes.

# What is pseudonymisation?
Pseudonymisation uses a form of encryption to translate identifiable personal data points to unique artificial identifiers - pseudonyms. It technique aims to de-link a person from personal data held under custodianship. This renders the data ‘pseudonymous’ within a specific use case, but beyond this use case the person can still be re-identified through clearly defined procedures and controls. This technique can applied to personal data as an acceptable security measure under GDPR to preventing linking personal data to the identity of the person to whom it belongs.

Pseudonymised data can still be traced to the data subject but it requires external information to do so. The personal data points still exist but through technically enforced separation and explicit amd implicit linking functions.

# What is personal data profiling?
In Article 4 (4), the UK GDPR defines Profiling as follows:
> _“ **'profiling’** means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements."_

Profiling can be used for predicting the data subject’s behaviour and can be a valuable tool for social media monitoring, and direct or indirect marketing and analysis. UK and EU GDPR also provides data subjects with rights related to automated decision making including profiling when the processing has legal or similarly significant consequences for them. For example, it is prohibited to deny a request for service or product based only on automated processing of the information about an individual without human oversight or intervention, becuase this could result in significant and potentially legal consequences for those individuals. 

# How to use pseudonymisation to your advantage?
Pseudonymised data is suitable for a wide range of analytical activities, research projects and for statistical purposes. Pseudonomysation exposes less personal data and decreases risk of abuse to exposed data, especially in the case of a personal data breach. In addition, UK and EU GDPR allows more relaxed standards for processing data that is pseudonymised compared to the processing of plain text personal data, which is motivating conytollers and processors to adopt pseudonymisation as a method for securing the personal data under their custodianship. When data is "strongly pseudonymised" it is less likely to “significantly affect” data subjects in the event of data leakage, or produce “legal effects” for them because they are less exposed to risk of re-identification.

If you or your organisation engages in profiling activities, pseudonomysing personal data prior to processing will be subject them to more relaxed standards. The application of advanced pseudonymisation techniques can provide acceptable “security measures” to safeguard data subjects’ rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. Using these techniques can yield positive results by creating identifiable groups and sub-groups of individuals that can be targeted with relevant product and service offerings.

When appropriately implemented and managed, pseudonymisation can open up more opportunities for processing personal data than processing plain text data without pseudonymisation as a security measure. However, it is still critcal to treat pseudonymised data as personal data, and to safeguard data subjects’ rights, freedoms and legitimate interests.

# How can we help?
Pseudonymisation techniques have well understood and intrinsic properties, but this does not render the choice and implementation of a right technique for a specific use case a trivial task in practice. Taking a risk-based approach, we help our clients assess data protection levels and their utility and scalability requirements, and help them shape their technology according to reguatory requirements. We help our clients to grow efficiently, impress their customers with high quality data privacy and protection programmes, and reduce risk by supporting:

* **Data controllers and processors** that need to carefully consider the implementation of pseudonymisation following a risk-based approach, taking into account the purpose and overall context of the personal data processing, as well as the utility and scalability levels they wish to achieve.

* **Producers of products, services and applications** who should provide adequate information to controllers and processors regarding their use of pseudonymisation techniques and the security and the data protection levels that they provide.
