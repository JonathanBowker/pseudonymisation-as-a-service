# What is pseudonymisation?
Pseudonymisation uses various forms of encryption to translate identifiable personal data points to unique artificial identifiers - **_Pseudonyms_** to hide their identities. Pseudonymisation techniques aim to decouple personal metadata data from master data sets and create pseudonym maps before placing them under the control of a data custodian - _**e.g. unit within an organisation, personal information managemet system, interconnected network of stakeholders, or a trusted third party provider**_. These techniques render personal data ‘pseudonymous’ for specific data use cases and business operations. 

Beyond the context of a specified use case, the individuals linked with personal data points can be identified, but only under strictly governed internal procedures and controls defined by the controlling data custodian. Within a pseudonymised data models, plain text personal data points still exist, but only within physically and logically separated and secure storage. Which can only be joined by pseudonym maps and secure linking functions that when authorised, facilate identification on-demand.

# What is personal data profiling?
In Article 4 (4), the UK GDPR defines Profiling as follows:
> _“ **'profiling’** means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements."_

Profiling can be used for predicting the data subject’s behaviour and can be a valuable tool for social media monitoring and direct or indirect marketing and analysis. UK and EU GDPR also provides data subjects with rights related to automated decision making and profiling, when the processing has legal or similarly significant consequences for them. For example, it is prohibited to deny a request for a service or product based only on automated processing of information about an individual without human oversight or intervention. This is becuase it could result in significant and potentially legal consequences for those individuals. An example could be refusal of a bank loan or insurance cover, or access to systems. 

# How to use pseudonymisation to your advantage?
We facilitate the use of pseudonymised data for a wide range of analytical activities, research projects and for statistical purposes as well as minimising risk of exposed personal data and abuse of that data in the case of a personal data breach. In addition, UK and EU GDPR allows more relaxed standards for processing data that is pseudonymised compared to the processing of personal data in a plain text form. This, is motivating data contollers to engage our pseudonymisation services for securing personal data under their control. Using our proprietary toolkit designed for hyper  pseudonymisation - Crypdex, we render personal as close to anonymised as possible so it is much less likely to **“significantly affect”** individuals in the event of personal data breach or leakage, or produce **“legal effects”** for them because they are much less exposed to re-identification risk.

If you engage in profiling activities, pseudonomysing personal data sets prior to processing will afford them to more relaxed standards. Through the application of advanced data strategy and pseudonymisation techniques apply regulator approved “security measures” to safeguard data subjects’ rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. By creating identifiable groups of pseudonyms decoupled from personal data and implicitly linked through data maps, we faciliate social media monitoring, and product and service targeting with minimal exposure to risk. When appropriately implemented and managed, pseudonymisation opens up more opportunities for processing personal data at high risk in plain text format. 

# How can we help?
Pseudonymisation techniques have well understood and intrinsic properties but this does not render the choice and implementation of a right technique for a specific use case a trivial task in practice. By taking a risk-based approach, we help our clients assess the data protection levels required by regulators in correlation with their requirements for utility and scalability. This helps them shape their technology according to regulatory requirements and supports:

* **Data controllers and processors** with the implementation of advanced pseudonymisation systems following, taking into account the purpose and overall context of their processing activities, in line with the utility and scalability levels they wish to achieve.

* **Producers of products, services and applications** with providing adequate information to controllers and processors regarding their use of pseudonymisation techniques to safegaurd personal data and the levels of data protection they provide.

# Advanced pseudonymisation service
We work closely with global privacy teams to provide practical guidance for risk assessment and advise on best practice in the field of data pseudonymisation. We provide access to the advanced tools, technologies and techniques needed for building state-of-the-art pseudonymisation management systems and automated compliance programmes.

## Service modules
The outline of the service is as follows:

- Implementing a dictionary of terms and relevant explanatory notes.
- Identifying scenarios where pseudonymisation needs to be engaged.
- Assessing adversarial and attack models for specific pseudonymisation use cases.
- Selecting appropriate pseudonymisation techniques and control procedures.
- Applying pseudonymisation techniques to identifiers and other sensitive data.
- Implementing a pseudonymisation management system and safegaurd automation.
- Providing ongoing support for state-of-the-art techniques for stakeholders.

Overall we focus on assessing, building and implementing technical legal solutions for personal data custodians with privacy by design. We facilitate the secure processing and management of personal data at scale.
