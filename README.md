# Pseudonymisation Techniques and Best Practices
## Advisory services on shaping technology according to data protection and privacy provisions

### Taking a risk-based approach to pseudonymisation
Pseudonymisation techniques have their own well understood and intrinsic properties but this does not render the choice of an appropriate technique a trivial task. We adopt a risk-based approach to assess the required protection level and consider relevant utility and scalability.

**Data controllers and processors need to carefully consider the implementation of pseudonymisation following a risk-based approach, taking into account the purpose and overall context of the personal data processing, as well as the utility and scalability levels they wish to achieve.**

**Producers of products, services and applications should provide adequate information to controllers and processors regarding their use of pseudonymisation techniques and the security and data protection levels that these provide.**

**Advanced Analytica can provide practical guidance to data controllers and processors with regard to the assessment of the risk, while advising on best practice in the field of pseudonymisation.**

# 1. INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICE

## 1.1 BACKGROUND
Pseudonymisation is a well-known de-identification process that has gained additional attention following the adoption of EU and UK GDPR, where it is referenced as both a security and data protection by design mechanism. **In addition, in the GDPR context, pseudonymisation can motivate the relaxation, to a certain degree, of data controllersâ€™ legal obligations if properly applied.**

## 1.2 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES

The overall scope of our services is to provide guidance and provide advise for best practices on the technical implementation of data pseudonymisation.

More specifically, the objectives of the report are as follows: 
  - Discuss different pseudonymisation scenarios and relevant actors involved. 
  - Identify possible pseudonymisation techniques in correlation with relevant adversarial and attack models. 
  - Analyse the application of pseudonymisation to specific types of identifiers, in particular IP addresses, email addresses, usernames and other types of structured data sets (use cases). 
  - Draw relevant conclusions and make recommendations for further work in pseudonymisation. 
  
It should be noted that uses case secenarios are generally based specific types of identifiers (IP addresses, email addresses, and username identifiers in structured data sets) that represent real-life scenarios. At the same time, use cases also reflect diverse requirements with regard to pseudonymisation, i.e. arising from the strict format of IP addresses to the more flexible structure of email addresses and the unpredictable nature of larger datasets. The target audience for our service are data controllers, data processors and producers of products, services and applications, and any other interested party in data pseudonymisation.

## 1.3 SERVICE OUTLINE

The outline of the setvice is as follows:
  - Establishing the terminology used with relevant explanatory remarks where needed.
  - Identifying the pseudonymisation scenario(s) that are or will be engaged in practice.
  - Detailing the adversarial and attack models with regard to pseudonymisation.
  - Selecting the pseudonymisation techniques and policies that are available today.
  - Analysing the application of different pseudonymisation techniques to identifiers (use cases).
  - Providing the conclusions and recommendations for all related stakeholders.

This service focuses on analysing technical solutions for the implementation of GDPR, privacy by design and security of personal data processing.
